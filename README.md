### OxyPlot is a cross-platform plotting library for .NET

* This library contains some adjustment for Universal Windows Platform that are to be published as the NuGet package OxyPlot.Windows.
* This library was created simply to use the OxyPlot.Core version 2.1.0. I worked for just adjusting the existing oxyplot-uwp repository in oxyplot, so using all the functionalities in oxyplot is unknown.
* The current NuGet OxyPlot.Windows package is 2.0.0-unstable1035, which will be out of date in the near future because the OxyPlot.Core version 2.1.0 is totally different from version 2.0.0. I don't know how this package were built as the original repository oxyplot/oxyplot-uwp itself couldn't make its package.
